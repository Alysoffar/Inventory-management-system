## üìù Coding Standards

### PHP Standards
- Follow PSR-12 coding standard
- Use Laravel best practices
- Write descriptive variable and method names
- Add PHPDoc comments for classes and methods

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Models\Product;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

/**
 * Inventory prediction service using AI algorithms
 */
class InventoryPredictionService
{
    /**
     * Predict demand for a specific product
     *
     * @param Product $product The product to predict demand for
     * @param int $days Number of days to predict
     * @return array Prediction results with confidence scores
     */
    public function predictDemand(Product $product, int $days = 30): array
    {
        // Implementation here
        return [
            'predicted_demand' => 150,
            'confidence' => 0.87,
            'trend' => 'increasing'
        ];
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Standards
- Use ES6+ features
- Follow consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

```javascript
/**
 * Initialize the inventory map with product locations
 * @param {Array} locations - Array of location objects
 * @param {string} containerId - ID of the map container
 */
function initializeInventoryMap(locations, containerId) {
    const map = L.map(containerId).setView([40.7128, -74.0060], 13);
    
    // Add tile layer
    L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png').addTo(map);
    
    // Add markers for each location
    locations.forEach(location => {
        L.marker([location.lat, location.lng])
            .bindPopup(location.name)
            .addTo(map);
    });
}
```

### CSS/SCSS Standards
- Use BEM methodology for class names
- Follow consistent indentation
- Group related properties together

```scss
// Good
.inventory-dashboard {
    &__header {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between;
        margin-bottom: 2rem;
    }
    
    &__stats-card {
        background: $card-bg;
        border-radius: $border-radius;
        padding: 1.5rem;
        box-shadow: $card-shadow;
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### PHP Tests
- Write feature tests for new endpoints
- Write unit tests for services and models
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use App\Models\Product;
use Tests\TestCase;

class InventoryTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    public function it_can_display_inventory_dashboard()
    {
        Product::factory()->count(5)->create();
        
        $response = $this->get('/inventory/dashboard');
        
        $response->assertStatus(200)
                ->assertViewIs('inventory.dashboard')
                ->assertViewHas('stats');
    }
    
    /** @test */
    public function it_can_predict_inventory_demand()
    {
        $product = Product::factory()->create();
        
        $response = $this->post('/api/ai/predict', [
            'product_id' => $product->id,
            'days' => 30
        ]);
        
        $response->assertStatus(200)
                ->assertJsonStructure([
                    'predicted_demand',
                    'confidence',
                    'trend'
                ]);
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Tests (if applicable)
```javascript
describe('Inventory Map', () => {
    test('should initialize map with correct center', () => {
        const map = initializeInventoryMap([], 'test-map');
        expect(map.getCenter()).toEqual({ lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060 });
    });
    
    test('should add markers for each location', () => {
        const locations = [
            { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060, name: 'Warehouse 1' },
            { lat: 40.7580, lng: -73.9855, name: 'Warehouse 2' }
        ];
        
        const map = initializeInventoryMap(locations, 'test-map');
        expect(map._layers).toHaveLength(3); // 1 tile layer + 2 markers
    });
});
```
